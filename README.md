# isingmodel
Fortran implementation of Ising model w/ Metropolis' algorithm. I have uploaded the naive implementation, which checks if each node is a boundary node to ensure periodic boundary conditions. This approach is really slow. As a rough approximation: a 50x50 lattice takes an average of 10834 milliseconds per Monte Carlo iteration, which roughly implies 4.3 milliseconds per node. Since this problem shows a time complexity of O(n^2), being n the number of nodes in each side of the square lattice, it is easy to see that runtime will escalate rapidly. For a 128x128 matrix and 1000 Monte Carlo iterations, it would take approximately 18-19 hours to complete the task. These estimations are based on my computer's performance, obviously. Therefore, a quicker approach needs to be implemented. I am currently working on it. 

The repository currently includes the program itself (with a suitable random number generator included) and an R script that I wrote for my own use. The R script needs to be tweaked if the size of the lattice changes.
